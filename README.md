# AC_GAM1545_FinalProject

Final project for GAM1545: Programming Fundamentals I.

For this project, I created a real-time windows console maze. Where the player has to move through the maze on the shortest amount of of time and move as possible. The mazes are read from a file, and there are persisting leaderboards files 

Some of the features in the game were:
* "Real-time" windows console maze, where the time and moves of the players are counted
* Player has to reach the end of the maze to finish the level
* Menu system to access the different mazes, leaderboards, and help section
* Clock pick-up to reduce the time for the player's current run
* Maze levels are loaded from a file
* The best 5 scores are saved to a leaderboard file. These scores can then be viewed in the main menu, or at the end of the game.
* Background music and different sound effects
* Special effect (color change, sound, etc.) to highlight when the player achieves a new highscore
